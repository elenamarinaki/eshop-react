# E-Shop Project with React 🛍️

## Production Notes 💭

- First we created a basic template of the project. We focused on creating a very elementary architecture of how we want the items to be presented on the page. 🌳
- All _elements_ are positioned for the time being inside the `HomePage` component. Later, they are going to move to their own folders and be their own components.
- Styling is done with `SASS` 💅.
